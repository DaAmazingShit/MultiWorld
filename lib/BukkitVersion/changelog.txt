v0.1:

+ Initial release

v0.2:

* Fixed main class startup for Beta 1.1's builds and early builds of 1.2_01

  'BukkitVersion.registerEvent(plugin, type, listener, priority);'
  'type' is a string representing an event to register (ex. "PLAYER_JOIN")

v0.3:

* Renamed 'registerEvent(...)' to 'registerEventSafely(...)'
+ Added 'registerEvent(...)', if you are ready to get some errors in the console
+ Added a secret message on startup (barely anyone will see it)
